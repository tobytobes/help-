!!update!!

I changed the address to link config.php slightly and it worked! But now we face further problems - the error message is as follows:
[13-Aug-2020 13:23:17 UTC] PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: sql in C:\MAMP\htdocs\project-1\public\create.php on line 25
[13-Aug-2020 13:23:17 UTC] PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: statement in C:\MAMP\htdocs\project-1\public\create.php on line 34
I have googled and cannot find the answer, and as the code was copied directy from y'all I dont know what to do!
